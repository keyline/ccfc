                                    In the city of Calcutta, then just over a hundred years old and growing fast both in
                                    commercial and political significance, the British Raj was busy setting its roots.
                                    And sports were definitely a part of the social lore.

                                    Indeed, sports events were reckoned to be important enough for sub-continental
                                    reporters. Fortunately, a copy of the Madras Courier dated 23rd. February, 1792 has
                                    survived. The paper reported cricket fixtures between the Calcutta Cricket Club and
                                    Barrackpore and the Calcutta Cricket Club and Dum Dum. Clearly, the Calcutta Cricket
                                    Club was already in existence in 1792.

                                    The story of how CC&FC traced its origins is interesting and is preserved in its
                                    archives thanks to Past President H.J. Moorhouse. It began in 1955 with a letter to
                                    The Times, London from Alan R. Tait, Honorary Secretary of Oporto Cricket Club in
                                    Portugal. The Club was celebrating its centenary that year, and Tait claimed that it
                                    'must be one of the oldest cricket club outside Great Britain'.

                                    This letter drew a good deal of response from several quarters. Several clubs were
                                    identified as being older than Oporto. To use a cricketing metaphor, the ball swung
                                    in Calcutta's favour when one Irwing Rosenwater wrote to the Times about the news
                                    item in the Madras Courier dated 23rd. February, 1792, mentioned above.

                                    In the absence of a permanent venue, the Calcutta Cricket Club played its games on
                                    the esplanade, parallel with the river Hooghly, between Fort William and Government
                                    House. By the 1820s, the members felt the need for a permanent ground. In 1825, the
                                    Calcutta Cricket Club managed to obtain the use of a plot of land on the Maidan as
                                    shown in the accompanying reproduction of the 'Sketch of the Maidan'. In 1841 the
                                    Club was allowed to enclose the ground by putting a fence around it. The Army,
                                    garrisoned at Fort William, however saw the Club as an encroacher and was extremely
                                    suspicious of its alleged motives! They complained to the Chief Magistrate and as a
                                    result the Club was relocated to the eastern boundary of the Auckland Circus
                                    Gardens.

                                    Good times were not to last. In 1862, the Brigadier General Commanding Presidency
                                    Division wrote to the Quarter Master General that 'open space is preserved, as a
                                    general rule around forts as a Military precaution. And in 1864 the Club members
                                    found that a new road was being constructed which would 'cut directly through the
                                    ground and pass within a few yards of that portion of it on which the match wickets
                                    are invariably pitched'
                                </div>
                                <div class="history-content">
                                    The Club's 'prayer' to the Governor General was rejected and it had to partially
                                    relocate to the ground on the eastern end of Eden Gardens, the current location of
                                    the test venue. The Club made several representations asking for permission to
                                    'erect a suitable pavilion in the place of the wretched hut now in use'. Finally on
                                    19 April the long awaited approval arrived. A handsome and well built pavilion
                                    measuring 125 ft by 25 ft was promptly constructed out of the finest teak brought
                                    from Burma. It even had a 'Long Room' on the lines of the MCC pavilion at Lords. The
                                    pavilion no longer exists. It was pulled in the mid 1970s for the construction of
                                    the Cricket Association of Bengal's modern B.C. Roy Clubhouse.

                                    The origin of the Ballgunge Cricket Club is a matter of some speculation. Possibly
                                    the uncertainties regarding playing cricket at Eden Gardens in the 1850s and early
                                    1860s led the players to form a separate Club in what was then a southern, civilian
                                    suburb of the city in 1864.

                                    In May 1884, G A James Rothney called a meeting and decided to restart the club
                                    because of the arrival of "excellent football material" which had come along with a
                                    few regiments. Rugby began in all earnestness and in 1890 the Calcutta Rugby Union
                                    Challenge Cup Tournament was inaugurated. A fine silver cup, promptly christened
                                    "Calcutta Cup" - was presented by past C F C Presidents. The tournament is played
                                    even today on the CCFC ground.

                                    The revival of the Calcutta Football Club in 1884 coincided with a renewed
                                    enthusiasm for soccer amongst Calcutta's expatriates. Three more European football
                                    clubs were formed between 1884 and 1889, along with a host of Indian football clubs.

                                    would be impaired if they join the competitive fray", it was instrumental in
                                    instituting the Indian Football Association (IFA) in Calcutta very much on London
                                    lines.

                                    In the initial years of the IFA Shield, CFC had a very creditable record. In 1950
                                    CFC was relegated. Declining membership also took its toll. On 14 May, 1963 CFC
                                    partially relinquished its exclusive rights on the Maidan tent and playing field in
                                    favour of Mohun Bagan Club and like Calcutta Cricket Club moved to Ballygunge.
